<h3><em>ABOUT ME</em></h3>
  </div>
  <p>Hi! My name is Anna and I’m currently a junior at LSU working towards a BFA in graphic design. I have been a creative person since I was a child and have found my passion in graphic design. Whether it’s branding, typography, or illustration, I pour my heart into every project I take on. I am always trying to step out of my comfort zone and try new things, and am eager to collaborate with others and learn something new.</p>
